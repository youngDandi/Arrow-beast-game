In the present project, we focus on developing a game using computer graphics concepts for the movements of the
different objects, collisions and three.js to model the objects in the environment. The project consists of two files, 
one of which is interpreted by the browser (index.html) and the other (main.js) contains all the logic for creating the game.
In this file we can find the "Three" classes (used to model the scene trees), the "Targets" class (used to model the 
circular targets and the humans), the "Beast" class (used to model the beast , the arrows, the rails and the platform used 
to move the crossbow) that are instantiated depending on the creation of the scene. The movement of the beast was made based 
on events and the targets was based on a function that receives random values ​​within an interval defined by us and limited 
by the existing bounding boxes at the ends of the arena (wall). Arrows are fired by pressing the "space" key, targets appear 
by pressing the "M" key and keys "1", "2" and "3" show the scene in top, front and side views and the beast moves left and 
right by pressing the left and right arrow keys.
